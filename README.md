I made a 2D game in this project. I used the minilibx library. I had a player that moved when wasd was pressed from the keyboard.
I read the map as an extra, the map would be surrounded by walls and there would be at least one exit.

## 1 Game
• The player’s goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape chosing the shortest possible route.
• The W, A, S, and D keys must be used to move the main character.
• The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right.
• The player should not be able to move into walls.
• At every move, the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell.
• You have to use a 2D view (top-down or profile).
• The game doesn’t have to be real time.
• Although the given examples show a dolphin theme, you can create the world you want.

## 2 Graphic management
• Your program has to display the image in a window.
• The management of your window must remain smooth (changing to another win-
dow, minimizing, and so forth).
• Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
• Clicking on the cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
• The use of the images of the MiniLibX is mandatory.

## 3 Map
• The map has to be constructed with 3 components: walls, collectibles, and free
space.
• The map can be composed of only these 5 characters: 0 for an empty space,
1 for a wall,
C for a collectible,
E for a map exit,
P for the player’s starting position.
Here is a simple valid map:
• The map must contain at least 1 exit, 1 collectible, and 1 starting position.
• The map must be rectangular.
• The map must be closed/surrounded by walls. If it’s not, the program must return
an error.
• You have to check if there’s a valid path in the map.
• You must be able to parse any kind of map, as long as it respects the above rules.
• Another example of a minimal .ber map:
• If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program must exit in a clean way, and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of your choice.
1111111111111
10010000000C1
1000011111001
1P0011E000001
• The map must be rectangular.
• The map must be closed/surrounded by walls. If it’s not, the program must return
an error.
• You have to check if there’s a valid path in the map.
• You must be able to parse any kind of map, as long as it respects the above rules.

1111111111111111111111111111111111
1E0000000000000C00000C000000000001
1010010100100000101001000000010101
1010010010101010001001000000010101

1111111111111111111111111111111111

• If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program must exit in a clean way, and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of your choice.

## Bonus Part

• Make the player lose when they touch an enemy patrol.
• Add some sprite animation.
• Display the movement count directly on screen instead of writing it in the shell.
